# See-We-Dev  

A Flow-Based Visual Programming for OpenCV.

CVDev has been designed and developed as a software tool that focused on reusablity.

Application development can be done by dragging boxes or nodes to create a diagram. The data is flowed from one node to another along the path that the user has dragged to link each node.

Each node can be combined together to make a new node that can be reuseable in many parts of the application as a plugins.
